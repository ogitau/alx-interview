## Introduction

UTF-8 (8-bit Unicode Transformation Format) is the most common character encoding used for text data. It is capable of encoding all possible characters (code points) in Unicode. This project provides tools to validate whether a sequence of bytes is a valid UTF-8 encoded text.

## Features

- Validate UTF-8 encoded data
- Support for variable-length encoding
- Efficient and easy-to-use implementation

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and ensure you have Python installed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/0x04-utf8_validation.git
cd 0x04-utf8_validation
